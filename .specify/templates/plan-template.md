# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

**Status:** Draft  
**Created:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Technical Context

### Technology Stack

[Describe the technology stack, frameworks, and libraries to be used. Mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION".]

### Architecture Decisions

[Describe architectural decisions, patterns, and design choices. Mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION".]

### Dependencies

[List external dependencies, services, and integrations required. Mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION".]

### Constraints

[Describe technical constraints, limitations, and trade-offs.]

## Constitution Check

### Principle Compliance

[For each principle in the constitution, verify compliance and note any violations or justifications.]

#### 1. Spec-Driven Development
- [ ] Specification is complete and technology-agnostic
- [ ] All requirements are testable

#### 2. RESTful API Design
- [ ] API endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- [ ] Standard HTTP methods and status codes used

#### 3. Input Validation & Security
- [ ] Input validation planned
- [ ] Authentication/authorization planned

#### 4. Activity Logging
- [ ] Activity logging planned for all mutations

#### 5. Error Handling
- [ ] Error handling strategy defined
- [ ] Appropriate HTTP status codes planned

#### 6. Performance Targets
- [ ] Performance targets defined
- [ ] Optimization strategy planned

#### 7. Data Consistency
- [ ] Data consistency strategy defined
- [ ] Concurrent update handling planned

#### 8. Testability
- [ ] Requirements are testable
- [ ] Testing strategy defined

### Gate Evaluation

[ ] All principles compliant or justified
[ ] No critical violations
[ ] Ready to proceed to Phase 0

## Phase 0: Research

### Research Tasks

[List research tasks needed to resolve NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from Technical Context.]

### Research Findings

[Consolidate research findings in research.md. Each finding should include:]
- Decision: [what was chosen]
- Rationale: [why chosen]
- Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model

[Reference data-model.md for entity definitions, relationships, and validation rules.]

### API Contracts

[Reference contracts/ directory for OpenAPI specifications.]

### Quick Start

[Reference quickstart.md for test scenarios and usage examples.]

## Phase 2: Implementation Strategy

[This section will be filled during task generation phase.]

### Implementation Phases

[Define implementation phases based on user story priorities.]

### Dependencies

[Define task and phase dependencies.]

## Notes

[Additional notes, assumptions, or considerations.]
